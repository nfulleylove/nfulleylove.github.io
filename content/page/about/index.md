Hello! :wave:

I'm a software developer who enjoys building straightforward, purposeful solutions that save time, reduce complexity, and provide a better experience for everyone involved.

This site is where I document what I’m learning – including the technology I'm working with, side projects, and observations from both work and life.

Outside of work, I'm often developing new skills, refining existing ones, and staying active.

You'll find a mix of technical exploration and personal perspective throughout.
