I'm a software developer experienced in developing and maintaining web applications and APIs, exposure to cloud technologies, and mobile applications.

This site is where I document what I’m learning – including the technology I'm working with, side projects, and observations from both work and life.

Outside of work, I'm often developing new skills, refining existing ones, and staying active.

You'll find a mix of technical exploration and personal perspective throughout.
